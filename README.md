# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI & Cloud Computing

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data using **Python, Power BI, and Cloud Computing**. The dataset was processed using **pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and PyTorch** to extract insights. The Power BI dashboard visualizes key churn trends, and all project files are stored in **AWS S3** for cloud hosting.

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **Data Cleaning** → Processed raw data using **Excel**.  
- **Data Preparation** → Loaded cleaned Excel files into a **Python notebook**.  
- **Normalization** → Split a dataset into **5 tables** for better structure.  
- **SQL Integration** → Connected and stored data in **SQL Server**.  
- **Querying** → Built SQL queries to analyze customer churn.  
- **Machine Learning** → Applied **Logistic Regression** and **GridSearchCV** for model optimization.  
- **Visualization** → Used **Matplotlib** for Python-based visualization and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.  

🚀 **Technologies Used**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, PyTorch), Power BI, AWS S3  
📡 **Cloud Integration**: Files stored on AWS S3 for accessibility  

## ☁️ Cloud Storage (AWS S3)
All project files, including Power BI dashboards, datasets, and notebooks, are hosted on **AWS S3** for easy access.

🔗 **Access All Files**: [AWS S3 Bucket](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/myfirstbucket12212?region=eu-north-1)
